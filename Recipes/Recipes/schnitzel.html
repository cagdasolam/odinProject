	</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as desired</li>
		<li>6 chicken breasts, cut in half lengthwise (butterflied)</li>
		<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
		<li>Â¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
		<li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
		<li>2 cups seasoned bread crumbs</li>
		<li>1 large lemon, zested</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and drizzle olive oil
			over foil. Place baking sheet in preheated oven.</li>
		<li>Flatten chicken breasts so they are all about 1/4-inch thick. Season chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
		<li>Mix flour and paprika together on a large plate. Beat eggs with salt and pepper in a shallow bowl. Mix bread
			crumbs and lemon zest together on a separate large plate. Dredge each chicken piece in flour mixture, then egg,
			and then bread crumbs mixture and set aside in 1 layer on a clean plate. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
		<li>Remove baking sheet from oven and arrange chicken in 1 layer on the sheet. Drizzle more olive oil over each
			piece of coated chicken.</li>
		<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes. Flip chicken and continue baking until no longer pink in the
			center and the breading is lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
			center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
	</ol>
