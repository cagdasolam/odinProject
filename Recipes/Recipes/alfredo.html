	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
		Alfredo is a creamy, dreamy pan sauce made from butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. There are a few additions
		and adaptations that exist. Unlike béchamel — another classic sauce — Alfredo is best made and eaten straight
		away. You can use Alfredo for coating broccoli or, most famously, fettuccine. Here, we’re partnering it with
		pasta and golden crispy chicken breast for a dinner that can make even the most regular Thursday night feel
		special.
	</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>8 ounces dried fettuccine pasta</li>
		<li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 pound total)</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
		<li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) Europesyle unsalted butter, divided</li>
		<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
		<li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
		<li>1 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese (2 1/2 ounces), plus more for serving</li>
		<li>1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
		<li>Coarsely chopped fresh parsley leaves, for serving</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Cook the pasta, drain, and reserve cooking water. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the
			fettuccine and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain
			the pasta.</li>
		<li>Dry the chicken and season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, pat both sides of the chicken breasts dry with
			paper towels. Season with 3/4 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper.</li>
		<li>Heat the oil over medium-high in a large frying pan. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high
			heat until shimmering, 2 to 3 minutes. If you have a pan that has straight sides, here's the time to use it.
			Do not use a nonstick pan.</li>
		<li>Add the chicken to the hot pan, and cook for 5 to 7 minutes. Swirl the pan just before adding the chicken to
			distribute the oil. Add the chicken and leave it alone for 5 to 7 minutes, until the bottom is golden-brown.
			If you try to to turn the chicken and it feels stuck, it isn't ready to flip.</li>
		<li>Flip the chicken and cook for another 5 to 7 minutes, until the chicken reaches 165°F. Flip the chicken over
			and add 1 tablespoon of the butter right between them. Pick up the pan and give it a gentle swirl to
			distribute the melting butter. Cook the chicken until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F, 5 to 7
			minutes more.</li>
		<li>Slice the chicken and cover to keep warm. Transfer the chicken to a plate or clean cutting board and let
			rest for 3 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Cover with aluminum foil while you prepare the rest of
			the dish.</li>
		<li>Melt the rest of the butter and sauté the garlic. Add the remaining 7 tablespoons butter to the same pan
			used for the chicken and place over medium heat until melted. Add the garlic and sauté until fragrant, 30
			seconds to 1 minute.</li>
		<li>Make the Alfredo sauce. Whisk in the cream, Parmesan, nutmeg, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4
			teaspoon pepper. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta
			cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time, to thin it out.</li>
		<li>Add the drained pasta and toss to coat in the sauce. Add the drained fettuccine to the sauce and toss to
			coat. Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish with parsley, more
			Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>

	</ol>
